Artwork Identification and Analysis System

Overview
This is a project on an artwork identification and analysis system that combines computer vision, machine learning, and art historical databases to provide comprehensive insights into artworks. 

It is meant to help you:

Identify unknown artworks

Classify art styles and movements

Attribute artworks to artists

Discover similar pieces

Enrich your knowledge with historical context

This project is a work in progress, aiming to bridge the gap between art and technology by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and extensive art databases.

Features
Core Functionality
Artwork Identification: Upload an image to identify the artwork, artist, and creation date.

Style Classification: Classify artworks into styles (e.g., Renaissance, Impressionism, Abstract).

Artist Attribution: Predict the artist with confidence scores.

Metadata Enrichment: Retrieve detailed information about the artwork, including historical context and provenance.

Similar Artwork Search: Discover visually and thematically similar artworks.

Advanced Features
Multi-Source Data Integration: Combines data from Google Art, Wikidata, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art API.

Hybrid Analysis: Uses both machine learning predictions and art historical databases for accurate results.

Explainable AI: Provides Grad-CAM visualizations to explain classification decisions.

Scalable Database: Stores artwork metadata and feature vectors for efficient retrieval and analysis.

How It Works
Image Upload: Users upload an image of an artwork.

Feature Extraction: A deep learning model extracts visual features from the image.

Metadata Retrieval: The system queries multiple APIs to gather historical and contextual data.

Analysis & Prediction: The model predicts the artwork's style, artist, and other attributes.

Results Display: Users receive a detailed report with identification results, historical context, and similar artworks.
